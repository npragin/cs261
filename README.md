# CS 261 Data Structures Assignments

This repository contains my assignments for CS 261 - Data Structures at Oregon State University. Each assignment focuses on implementing and understanding fundamental data structures and algorithms.

## Course Description

CS 261 is a comprehensive course covering essential data structures and algorithms that form the foundation of computer science. The course covers abstract data types, dynamic arrays, linked lists, trees and graphs, binary search trees, hash tables, storage management, and complexity analysis of data structures.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 or higher (no external dependencies)

## Assignments

### [Assignment 1: Python Review and Static Array](./static_array/)
Implementation of fundamental algorithms using static arrays including sorting algorithms (bubble sort, counting sort), array manipulation functions, and Python programming fundamentals.

### [Assignment 2: Dynamic Array and ADT Implementation](./dynamic_array_and_set/)
Implementation of a dynamic array data structure with automatic resizing and a Bag ADT (Abstract Data Type) built on top of the dynamic array.

### [Assignment 3: Queue, Stack, and Singly Linked List](./queue_stack_and_linked_list/)
Comprehensive implementation of fundamental linear data structures using both array-based and linked-list approaches.

### [Assignment 4: Binary Search Tree and AVL Tree](./bst_and_avl/)
Implementation of binary search trees and self-balancing AVL trees with complete traversal algorithms and balancing mechanisms.

### [Assignment 5: Hash Maps - Separate Chaining and Open Addressing](./hash_maps/)
Implementation of hash map data structures using two different collision resolution strategies: separate chaining and open addressing with quadratic probing.

### [Assignment 6: Min Heap Implementation](./min_heap/)
Implementation of a min heap data structure with heap sort algorithm, built on dynamic arrays for efficient priority queue operations.

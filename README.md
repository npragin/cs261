# CS 261 â€“ Data Structures

This repository contains my assignments for CS 261 - Data Structures at Oregon State University. Each assignment focuses on implementing and understanding fundamental data structures and algorithms.

## Course Description

CS 261 is a comprehensive course covering essential data structures and algorithms that form the foundation of computer science. The course covers abstract data types, dynamic arrays, linked lists, trees and graphs, binary search trees, hash tables, storage management, and complexity analysis of data structures.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 or higher (no external dependencies)

## Assignments

### [Assignment 1: Python Review and Static Array](./static_array/)
An implementation of various algorithms and functions using a static array. This assignment serves as a warm-up for Python skills and introduces fundamental array operations.

### [Assignment 2: Dynamic Array and Bag Implementation](./dynamic_array_and_set/)
An implementation of a dynamic array with automatic resizing and an abstract bag structure built on top of the dynamic array.

### [Assignment 3: Queue, Stack, and Singly Linked List](./queue_stack_and_linked_list/)
An implementation of fundamental linear data structures: Queue, Stack, and Singly Linked List (SLL). A queue and stack are implemented using both static arrays and singly linked lists to demonstrate different approaches.

### [Assignment 4: Binary Search Tree and AVL Tree](./bst_and_avl/)
An implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) and an AVL Tree (self-balancing BST) with traversal algorithms and balancing mechanisms.

### [Assignment 5: Hash Maps - Separate Chaining and Open Addressing](./hash_maps/)
An implementation of hash maps using two different collision resolution strategies: Separate Chaining and Open Addressing with Quadratic Probing.

### [Assignment 6: Min Heap Implementation](./min_heap/)
An implementation of a Min Heap using a dynamic array as the underlying storage. The heap maintains the min-heap property where the parent node is always smaller than or equal to its children.
